# Udacity_GenAI

This repo contains the exercise notebooks of Udacity Generative AI course in which I took part. I've used `conda` to setup the development environment and package management. When talking about models, we mean LLMs. 

## Exercises

1. Exercise 1: Generating one token at a time

    This exercise tells about how **LLM**s tokenize the text data. Tokenize means dividing the text data in such a way so that the model can understand. Along with that the exercise describes how the model predicts the next couple of words along with their probabilites.

2. Exercise 2: Classifying images of handwritten digits using multi-layer perceptron

    This exercise shows a workflow to use the **MLP**(multi-layer perceptron) to classify a *MNIST* dataset to classify a set of picture of handwritten digits from 0 to 9.

3. Exercise 3: Basics of Pytorch and Hugging Face. 
    
    This exercise teaches the functioning of **Neural Net**, how to set it up and *sentiment analysis* of some imdb movie reviews using a model from Hugging Face.

4. Exercise 4: Transfer learning using **MobileNetV3**

    MobileNetV3 is a light weight neural network used to classify images. This exercise is using this model to classfying an MNIST fashion image dataset and calculating the accuracy of the model.
