# Udacity_GenAI

This repo contains the exercise notebooks of Udacity Generative AI course in which I took part. I've used `conda` to setup the development environment and package management. When talking about models, we mean LLMs. 

## Exercises

1. Exercise 1: Generating one token at a time

    This exercise tells about how **LLM**s tokenize the text data. Tokenize means dividing the text data in such a way so that the model can understand.
